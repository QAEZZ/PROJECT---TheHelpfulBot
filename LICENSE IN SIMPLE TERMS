"GPL, or the GNU General Public License, is an open source license meant for software. 
If your software is licensed under the terms of the GPL, it is free. However, “free”
here does not essentially mean freeware—it can also be a paid software. Instead, “free”
as per the GPL means freedom. As proponents of GPL proudly proclaim, free as in freedom,
not free beer. As such, your users are free to modify and distribute your software
however their needs call for. Unlike other proprietary or closed source licenses, GPL
does not seek to impose restrictions and limitations on the freedom of others. Compare
GPL with the EULA (End User License Agreement) that often accompanies closed source
software–GPL lets you change the software as per your needs, share and distribute the
software, or even share and distribute the changed product. The EULA, on the other hand,
gives you a non-exclusive license to use one copy of the software–no changing, no
tweaking, no distributing, and so on."
